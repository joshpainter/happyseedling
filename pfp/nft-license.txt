For clarity, this AGREEMENT does not otherwise govern the transaction that is effectuated on any blockchain when you buy or offer to buy any JOSHPAINTER NFT, including through any related decentralized technologies, websites, services, tools, applications, smart contracts, and APIs, which are provided by third party vendors and governed by and subject to the terms of use provided by those third party vendors, unless such third party terms of use conflict or are inconsistent with the terms of this AGREEMENT, in which case the terms of this AGREEMENT shall prevail. Subject to the foregoing, this AGREEMENT supplements the terms of service and privacy policy that otherwise govern your use of the JOSHPAINTER websites, services and application. By accepting ownership of the JOSHPAINTER NFT, you agree to abide by the terms of this AGREEMENT.

7. Limitation of Liability
In no event will JOSHPAINTER be liable to you for any special, incidental, exemplary, indirect, punitive, or consequential damages (including loss of profits) with respect to the subject matter of this AGREEMENT, whether such liability arises from any claim based upon contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, and whether or not you have been advised of the possibility of such loss or damage.
