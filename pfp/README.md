What is a Happy Seedling?
---
In the Chia world, you’ll find many references to farming and harvesting and plots as well as the efficiencies that Proof of Space and Time (PoST) bring to a world increasingly concerned with green technologies. A Happy Seedling is somebody who is just getting started in the Chia world and would like to learn a bit more about what is going on behind the scenes. 

If this describes you, welcome! You’ll find good company here amongst friends who are obsessed with learning and sharing their experiences. If you haven’t yet watched The Happy Seedling series on YouTube (link), be sure to check that out! You’ll get a solid grasp of the fundamentals in a few hours or less and you’ll have a big head start on the official documentation should you decide to dig deeper.

Overview

This guide is meant to not only describe the Happy Seedling project and some of the decisions that were made but also to help you  plan your own Chia NFT project. Minting an NFT may appear to be simple on the surface, but it will only go smoothly if you have put in the time to set up your infrastructure and you have thought through your minting process.
